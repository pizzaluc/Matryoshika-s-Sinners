-------------------------------------------

##Matryoshika's Sinners is a [Minecraft] (https://minecraft.net/) mod, based on The 7 Deadly Sins.
###The main idea of this mod is to implement a stable, yet enriching end-game.
Server stability is also a holy law to enforce that Entities and/or TileEntities added by this mod will have as low of an impact on any server as possible.

Initial idea originated from MOTHY-P's [Evillious Chronicles] (http://theevilliouschronicles.wikia.com/wiki/The_Evillious_Chronicles_Wiki), as well as influenced by ideas from 
[Forbidden Magic] (http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445828-tc4-addon-forbidden-magic-v0-57) & [Botania] (http://botaniamod.net/). Without their respective owners, this mod would not exist.
Please praise SpitefulFox & Vazkii as the coding gods that they are.
