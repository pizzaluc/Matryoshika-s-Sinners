Matryoshika AKA The Mod-Author retains all rights of this mod, or any derivatives of it.
Permission is granted for Private use.
Private use in this context is using this mod for only yourself, or in a group of up to 8 players.
If more than 8 players in a group have access to this mod, it is seen as in a public modpack.
Demanding economic means from players, or cutting of my mod, whole or in parts, violates the Private 
use permission.
Donations made through free-will do not count towards commercial play.

Unless given explicit, written permission, this mod may not be distributed outside official 
locations.

The only allowed means of modification without explicit permission is through the official GitHub 
(https://github.com/Matryoshika/Matryoshika-s-Sinners), through Forking & Pull-Requests.
This is to ensure that all issues are properly documented, fixed and distributed from the source.
Any other means of modifications is forbidden.

Sublicense permissions may be granted by the Mod-Author, if there is a good reason behind it.

Adding my mod to a public modpack is forbidden without explicit permission. Please get in touch 
with the Mod-Author and request permission.
	This is due to my subpar coding, and my perfectionist requirements of myself. I want to know 
	who, when, where, and with what my mod is added to, and what will cause issues with it.


Players are allowed to:
	Use my mod for private play.

	Make private modpacks with my mod.
		Private modpack in this context is seen as a modpack that is available for only 8 or less 
		players.
	
	Create Let's Plays and/or stream content of my mod.
	
	Fork and create Pull-Requests on the official GitHub.
	
	Request ideas and create Localization for my mod.
	
Anything else is forbidden unless given explicit permission from the Mod-Author.

Conditions will be changed once this mod is out of Alpha-release.
